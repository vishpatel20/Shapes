# Shapes

This is a shapes program which explains a lot of featuers in c++ such as inheritance, composition and .h files. It will show how 
to write .h files and how to use them to write a file using prototypes. 

This program will allow user to choose a shape and then it will give them the dimensions of that shape and also it the shape is filled with color or not. Please
take the time to read the code and how each file interacts with each other.

Enjoy!!!!
